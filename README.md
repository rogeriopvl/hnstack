# Hacker News Stack - Chrome extension

## Info
This Google Chrome extension lets you focus on the really fresh and unread news in YCombinator - Hacker News. It relocates read items into the bottom of the HN website.

## Installation:

- You can install it from the [chrome extensions gallery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jcdfcpjmfpbnimkdackbcmdgdpoeklio).

## Known Issues
- Clicking upvote before opening an article link has a weird behaviour. It hides the upvote arrow (like it should) but when the article link goes to the bottom of the page, the arrow reapears. The vote only counts if the upvote button is clicked when the article is already listed at the bottom of the page (in the read items).

## Credits
- Thanks to [Pedro Borges](http://pedroborgesdesign.com) for his work on this extension's icon.
